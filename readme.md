Easy3D - webGL
----------
Yet another JS 3D/game engine test

Trying out webGL, transfering most of my old Delphi and C# OpenGL game engine structure in webGL

* ver4.html for current status/WIP
* ver3.txt for engine target structure.
* tuto1.html basic re-transcript of webGL tutorial.
* tuto2.html added a lot of controls abstraction.
* ver3.html working model loading and most of engine neatly packaged.
* test1.html performance benchmarking for various JS and gl-matrix.js. 
* Works with mouse/keyboard in destktop browser, touch controls for mobile.

Current work-in-progress
----------
* Animations
* Multidraw on entity !
* Sprites
* Collision detection (vector, sphere/elipsoid, plane/cuboid)
* Model loading (ideally external tool should prepare model data for better load perf)

Next Steps
-----------
1. Replace per-vertex colors with textures
2. Other type of physics mechanic for controls.
3. Sounds
4. Some kind of game :P
5. NetCode !
6. Better lights shaders (array of different types of ligts) (spot, point etc)
