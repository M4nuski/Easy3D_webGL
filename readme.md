Easy3D - webGL
----------
Yet another JS 3D/game engine test

Trying out webGL, transfering most of my old Delphi and C# OpenGL engine structure in webGL

* ver3.txt for basic target structure.
* ver3.html for current status.
* tuto1.html basic re-transcript of webGL tutorial.
* tuto2.html added a lot of controls abstraction.
* Works with mouse/keyboard in destktop browser, touch controls for mobile.

Current work-in-progress
----------
* Plucking the hard-coded logic from main script (ver3.js) to classes.
* Adding different mode to interface gaming controls on mobile.

Next Steps
-----------
1. Replace per-vertex colors with textures
2. Other type of physics mechanic for controls.
3. Sounds
4. Some kind of game :P
5. NetCode !
