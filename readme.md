Easy3D - webGL
----------
Yet another JS 3D/game engine test

Trying out webGL, transfering most of my old Delphi and C# OpenGL game engine structure in webGL

* ver3.txt for basic target structure.
* ver4.html for current status.
* tuto1.html basic re-transcript of webGL tutorial.
* tuto2.html added a lot of controls abstraction.
* Works with mouse/keyboard in destktop browser, touch controls for mobile.

Current work-in-progress
----------
* Adding different mode to interface gaming controls on mobile.
* Collision detection (vector, sphere/elipsoid, plane/cuboid)
* Entity culling
* Animation, sprites
* Adding model loading (ideally external tool should prepare model data for better load perf)

Next Steps
-----------
1. Replace per-vertex colors with textures
2. Other type of physics mechanic for controls.
3. Sounds
4. Some kind of game :P
5. NetCode !
6. Better lights shaders (array of different types of ligts) (spot, point etc)
